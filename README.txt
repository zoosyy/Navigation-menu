Interesting popup menu on hover.
I took the idea of ​​such a menu in a frame from computer games, against the background of Berserk. Favorite anime and the background is chosen organically to make everything look great.
This menu was created using only HTML and CSS. I didn’t use JS, because I didn’t consider it necessary to load simple cozy work.

İf you have any questions :
